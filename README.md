##  Finding Lost Child Through Structural Similarity Using ML Approach

This project proposes a solution that uses machine learning techniques, specifically structural similarity and facial recognition, to detect and identify missing children in real-time. By analysing images or video frames captured from surveillance cameras or public spaces, the system can compare the captured faces with known images of missing children. It will provide instant alerts with crucial details like location, photograph, and the time of the incident, enhancing the speed of detection and increasing the chances of safely locating the child.

## STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY
A perceptual metric used to measure the similarity between two images. It is particularly useful in machine learning tasks involving image processing, computer vision, and image quality assessment. Unlike pixel-wise metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM focuses on structural information, which is more aligned with human visual perception.

## FACIAL RECOGNITION
The face_recognition library provides methods to detect faces within images or
video frames. It utilizes pre-trained face detection models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This
library captures the landmarks of the face (like distance between the eyes, lips,
distance of nose etc..). These landmarks are crucial for tasks like aligning faces,
measuring facial features, and improving face recognition accuracy. It utilizes a
deep learning-based face recognition model trained on a large dataset of faces.
This model extracts unique facial features, often referred to as face
embeddings, which represent each face in a high-dimensional space. By
comparing these embeddings, the library can determine whether two faces
belong to the same person or not.

## FRONTEND
### HTML - HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, 
serves as the backbone of web development, providing the structure and organization
for content on the internet. Using a system of tags and attributes, HTML
defines the elements of a webpage, including text, images, links, and
more. It acts as the foundation upon which websites are built, allowing
developers to create structured and semantically meaningful documents
that are accessible and easily interpreted by web browsers.

### CSS - CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, 
complements HTML by adding style and visual presentation to web pages. With CSS, developers
can control the layout, design, and appearance of HTML elements,
including aspects such as colours, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.
By separating style from content, CSS promotes cleaner and more
maintainable code, allowing for consistent design across multiple web
pages and devices.

### JAVA SCRIPT - JavaScript, often referred to as the "language of the web,"
is a versatile programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic
behaviour to websites. As a client-side scripting language, JavaScript
executes code directly within the web browser, enabling tasks such as
form validation, animations, and event handling. It interacts seamlessly
with HTML and CSS, allowing developers to create engaging user
experiences and responsive web applications that adapt to user input and
device capabilities. JavaScript's flexibility and ubiquity make it an
essential tool for modern web development, powering many of the
interactive features users encounter daily on the web.

## NOTIFICATION
### STMP server 
SMTP is a communication protocol widely used for electronic
mail (email) transmission. An SMTP server is a software application or
hardware device responsible for sending, receiving, and relaying email
messages between email clients and other SMTP servers.

### TinyDB

TinyDB is a lightweight, open-source document-oriented database
designed for simplicity and ease of use in Python applications. It operates as a
JSON document store, making it ideal for storing small to moderate amounts of
data with minimal setup. With TinyDB, you can store, retrieve, and manipulate
data using a simple API, making it a convenient choice for projects where a
full-fledged database might be overkill. Its simplicity and flexibility make it
popular for small-scale applications, prototyping, and educational purposes.
